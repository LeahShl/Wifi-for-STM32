# Linux ✨Multithreaded✨ CLI Program for STM32F756ZG Verification
A Linux-based testing program for STM32F756ZG peripheral validation via UDP communication.

Almost the same as the [single-threaded](https://github.com/LeahShl/FreeRTOS-HW-Verification/tree/main/FILES_FOR_PC/single_threaded) version, but ✨Multithreaded✨. Compile with `make` and run with `./mthw_tester` instead of `./hw_tester`. That's it.
